# Comparison of Various ML Algorithms


In this I've taken the dataset of energy meter which is taken with the help of rasberry pi and with compared various Machine Learning algorithms to find which is most optimised and will give best accuracy according to the given dataset. In the Evaluation Code I've evaluated that which ML algorithm is giving the best accuracy and in my case, Logistic Regression and SVM are the highest. So, in the training and testing code I've deployed SVM to predict the output. Also, I've commented Logistic Regression, If you wanna use logictic regression just comment the SVM part and use Logistic Regression part.


NOTE: You cna change dataset according to you :)
