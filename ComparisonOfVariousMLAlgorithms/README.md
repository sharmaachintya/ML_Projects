# Comparison of Various ML Algorithms


In this I've taken the dataset of energy meter which is taken with the help of rasberry pi and with compared various Machine Learning algorithms to find which is most optimised and will give best accuracy according to the given dataset. 

NOTE: You cna change dataset according to you :)
